<h1>School</h1>

<p>My school life began at a place called Rye Country Day. I attended for
both preschool and kindergarten. I then moved onto 1st-8th grade, which
took place at North Hampton Middle School. This is where my sports
career began and where I got my foundational schooling done.</p>

<p> In 2011, I began high school at my towns public school, Winnacunnet
High School. I only attended for a year there. I then transferred to a
private school about 30 minutes from my home town called Saint Thomas
Aquinas High School. I graduated from there in 2015 as a three sport
student athlete.

<p> After Saint Thomas, I attended Plymouth State University for two
semesters. I then transferred to Great Bay Community College for my next two semesters. I'm
currently onto my third and final college, the University of Maine. It
took me three tries but I finally found the perfect school. I plan to
graduate in 2019 with a double major in Finance and Management.
