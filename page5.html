<h1>Family</h1>

<p> Family is the most important thing to me. Without my family, I
wouldn't be where I am today. Whenever life gets hard, family is where
you turn. For me, I'm fortunate enough to have both of my parents and a
sister who is always there for me.</p>


<p>My sister is 23 and went to our rival
school, UNH, and graduated with a degree in Biomedical Science. She
currently is enrolled in a nursing program at Simmons College in Boston
and works full time at Boston Children's Hospital.</p>

<p> My dad grew up in Massachusetts and my mom grew up in California. They
 met while my dad was getting his masters degree in California and have
 been happy ever since. My parents provide me with everything and have
 formed me into the man I am today. I was fortunate enough to be able to
 attend the University of Maine with the help financially from my hard
 working parents.</p>
