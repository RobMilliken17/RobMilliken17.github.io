  <p>I like to adventure, as seen in these four pictures!
   I've been around sports my whole life, I played football, basketball,
 and baseball for as long as I can remember. I've also enjoyed surfing,
 hiking, and fishing. If someone asks me to do something fun outdoors, I
 will say yes.</p>


<p> Doing fun stuff is the only thing that keeps me sane. It allows me to
experience life in a different way and to the fullest. I try to get out
a lot on weekends to relieve myself from all the stress of school. Going
on hikes and working out usually does the trick. For the rest of my life
I plan on being adventurous and going a bit out of my comfort zone to
allow myself to live and be happy.
