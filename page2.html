<body>

<p> I was born on June 17th, 1997 in Chicago, IL. I lived in Chicago until I
was two. I moved to Hampton, New Hampshire and lived here ever since. I
have lived less than a mile away from the beach almost my whole life.
This has allowed me to grow up surfing and have a childhood that most
don't have. I practically live in the water and have enjoyed every
second of it.</p>
